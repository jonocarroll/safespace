Description: Provides a safe space where beginners interested in learning how 
    to contribute to open source software can start,  without having to worry 
    about making mistakes. Learners practice using a real, but toy package using 
    the R language. It is intended that at the end, learners are able to 
    contribute pull requests using R, Rstudio, git and github.
