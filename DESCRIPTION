Description: It provides tools for calculating the Jacobian matrix and its determinant for invertible matrices in multivariable calculus. 
    It is specifically designed for mathematical, scientific, and statistical applications where the Jacobian is needed to understand 
    how small changes in input variables impact outputs in vector-valued functions. The package supports efficient and accurate 
    computation of the Jacobian for nonlinear systems and transformations, and can be integrated into workflows involving optimization, 
    differential equations, and numerical analysis.
